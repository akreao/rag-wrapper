# Web portal review

Questions asked about the finished portal (PR #2), one at a time.

- **Forgotten passwords: an admin sets a new one.** There's no email on a LAN server, so the admin page for an account has a "Reset password" form. The admin tells the player the new password and the player changes it on their own account page. Email reset links are out.
- **Bans don't kick players already in game.** The portal only writes the database, so a ban stops the next login. The ban form tells admins to use `@kick` in game for someone who's online. No rathena fork change for this.
- **Birthdate is required at sign-up.** With `char_del_option: 2` the game checks the birthdate when a player deletes a character, so an account without one could never delete characters. Players can change it on their account page.
- **Admin pages are for Admins (group 99) only.** Lower GM groups such as Law Enforcement get no portal access. A moderator role (ban and reset, but no GM-level changes) can be added later if needed.
