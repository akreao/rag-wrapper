# Decisions

Choices made while planning rag-wrapper, newest last. Each says what was decided and what it means for the build.

## Scope

- **Fresh app**, not built on Ragnarok Offline.
- **Linux only** for now. Docker is an accepted requirement.
- **Real game client**, no roBrowser. `PACKETVER` is 20220406 until the client's date is confirmed.
- rAthena is built from `akreao/rathena` `master`.

## Who connects: LAN

The server is for this machine and others on the same local network, not the internet.

- The app detects the machine's LAN IP and uses it as `PUBLIC_IP`, so other PCs on the network are sent a reachable char and map address.
- Ports 6900, 6121, 5121 and 8888 are published on the LAN. No port forwarding, public IP or DNS setup.
- Moving to internet play later means changing `PUBLIC_IP` and tightening account defaults; nothing else in the stack has to change.
